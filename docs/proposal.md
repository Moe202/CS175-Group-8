# 2.2 Summary of the Project
Solve an intricate maze with traps, lava, etc. Optimize by trying to improve the time the agent solves the maze or by finding the most optimal path. The input of the project would require a section of the map the agent would traverse. Output would be the most optimal path discovered by the agent. Plans to involve more intricate maps with zombies that block sections of map. This may require the agent to deal with timing issues. Lastly, we assume that every block is unknown and the agent must discover each path. Direct applications of this project would allow users to optimally beat multiple video games. At a high level, reinforcement learning discovered from this project can determine the ideal behavior within the manufacturing, delivery, and finance industries.

# 2.3 AI/ML Algorithms
Q-learning and reinforcement learning. Plans to implement computer vision if team finishes early. For example, recognizing how to avoid zombies when finding an optimal path.
